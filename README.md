# freeswitch_dutch_sounds
I've translated some audio files from Freeswitch to Dutch. Only thing I changed is the voicemail including the "time" directory. In this directory are all the soundtracks, also English soundtracks which I haven't touched. Based on FreeSWITCH Version 1.10.2.

## How to intergrate

This method only works if you don't need the English soundtracks anymore:
Just copy paste the directory and everything should work. Please check if your version didn't add new soundfiles before you entirely delete your old files. To prevent this from happening is just to not delete the old directory but overwrite the basic directory with the files from this directory. 

If you want to keep the English soundtracks: 

Then you should search for a way on Google to add multiple soundtrack directories.
